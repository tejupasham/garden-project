# Project Botanico.

Firstly we use the browser development console to log error messages, and network tab to monitor network calls and their responses. Like when we use the same user credentials to register, we get error. Next we render this error in the UI using a toast message. Similarly, if we login using a user's credentials that isn't registered, we get user doesn't exist error, which we monitor in the console and then render in the UI.
